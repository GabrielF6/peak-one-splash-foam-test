### gabriel freire test

    current git changes made for this test, ps: I focused only on the quantity selector on desktop, ignoring mobile cause I didnt have much time to do this test, altough I know it was basicaly add tailwind styles for the breakpoints md: sm: lg, etc and change spacing and sizing, so I count with your comprehention, I hope what I did here was enough to display how capable I am of getting this job, king regards, Gabriel :)
